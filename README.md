You have been called upon to put together some reference materials for other groups to follow, since up until now they have not created any formal architectural documents. Create a System Reference Guide for your employer in three parts over Weeks Two, Three, and Four.

In this week, write the first section of the Guide: a 1,000- to 1,050-word paper, using MicrosoftÂ® Word, addressing the listed software architectures.

Find an example of a well-known commercial software system for each. Give the name and purpose/function of the system, and write no less than 250 words for each system explaining why this is an example of that architecture.

The architectures are:

Client/ServerPeer-to-peer (P2P)Distributed computing (cloud, grid, etc.)Monolithic (standalone)
